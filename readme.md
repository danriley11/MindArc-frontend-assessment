# Documentation

## Questions I should've asked before beginning

1. What font-family, font-size, line-height, font-weight values are used or ideal for this task.

# Banana question

1. `'b' + 'a' equals a string of 'ba'`
2. `+ + 'a' attempts to convert a to a number, returning NaN (Not a Number)`
3. `'baNaN + a equates to 'baNaNa'`
4. `'baNaNa.toLowerCase() conceals the NaN and returns 'banana'`

- This was really fun for me to learn!
